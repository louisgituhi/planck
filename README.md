# Planck a Scientist API

This API provides information about scientists, their discoveries, and awards.

# Features

+ Retrieve a list of scientists and their details

+ Includes information on discoveries, Nobel Prizes, and other awards

+ Uses Zod for schema validation

+ Supports modern dates but does not support BC and AD era dates

# Schema

The API follows the below schema for scientist data validation:

```ts
const scientistSchema = z.array(
    z.object({
        id: z.number({ message: "Id should be a number" }),
        name: z.string(),
        nationality: z.string(),
	category: z.nativeEnum(CategoryEnum),
        description: z.string(),
        date_of_birth: z
            .string()
            .date("Date should follow the format of YYYY-MM-DD"),
        date_of_death: z
            .string()
            .date("Date should follow the format of YYYY-MM-DD")
            .nullable(),
        discoveries: z.array(
            z.string({ message: "Array items should be strings" })
        ),
        nobel_prize: z
            .array(
                z.object({
                    category: z.string(),
                    year: z.number().gte(1901, {
                        message: "Nobel prizes started being awarded in the year 1901",
                    }),
                    study: z.string(),
                })
            )
            .nullable(),
        other_awards: z.array(z.string()).nullable(),
    })
);
```

# Getting Started

## Install dependencies
```
bun install
```
This should install all the dependencies

Once installed run:

```
bun --watch index.ts
```
You should now access it on port 3000 ðŸŽ‰
## Development
+ Home ```http://localhost:3000/```
+ All scientists ```http://localhost:3000/scientists```
+ Random scientist ```http://localhost:3000/scientists/random```
+ Pass a name to get specific scientist ```http://localhost:3000/scientists/albert```
